## Overview
PRISMS-MultiPhysics (PRISMS-MP) open-source, coupled phase field-crystal plasticity framework.

<!-- ![PRISMS-MP Example Results](assets/example_bar.png) -->

***
## Announcements

- 9/19/2025: We are release of Webpage and [Users Manual](https://prisms-center.github.io/multiPhysics/doxygen/index.html): Both of these are still under construction.

([older announcements](pages/announcements.md))

### Features and Capabilities

- Matrix-free finite element framework for improved performance over traditional finite element approaches
- Parallelization at the inter-node, intra-node, and intra-core levels (MPI, threads, vectorization), with near ideal scaling beyond 1,000 cores
